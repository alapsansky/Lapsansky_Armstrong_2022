# Lapsansky & Armstrong (2022)


### WARINING: This work is currently in review at [Marine Ornithology](https://www.marineornithology.org/) and should considered preliminary until this warning is removed and replaced.


### Abstract:


Common Mergansers *Mergus merganser* dive into lakes, rivers, and coastal waters to feed on fish and other aquatic prey. This species, and others in the genus Mergus, are traditionally classified as foot-propelled divers. When submerged, mergansers are expected to swim by kicking their feet, holding their wings close to their bodies. Here, we report, with video evidence, an event in which four mergansers used their wings underwater to chase down and capture a large fish. Documentation of wing use in this classically defined “foot-propelled diver” illustrates the gaps in our understanding of avian diving physiology, hydrodynamics, and behavior.

### Navigating the data


This repository contains the digitized points ("points" folder), MATLAB code files, raw figure, and the supplemental video related to the paper. 


To view the digitized points and the identities of the digitized birds, one can use the DLTdv digitizing tool in MATLAB  (https://biomech.web.unc.edu/dltdv/). After installing the tool, the project can be loaded by selecting "New Project", followed by the included video and the files in "points" folder.


The description of the speed analysis are included in the MATLAB script.
